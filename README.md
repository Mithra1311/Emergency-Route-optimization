# Emergency-Route-optimization
A Python-based Emergency Route Optimization system using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and OSRM. It calculates the fastest route between locations and visualizes it on an interactive map, designed to assist in emergency response scenarios like ambulance dispatch and rescue operations.

Features
Uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for pathfinding.
Displays results on an interactive map in the browser.
Helps emergency vehicles (ambulance, fire, police) reach their destination quickly.
Modular design for easy updates and integration with other systems.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mithra1311/Emergency-Route-Optimization.git
cd Emergency-Route-Optimization


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Run the main script:
python main.py

Open your browser and view the interactive route output.

Future Improvements
Real-time traffic data integration for more accurate route optimization.
Support for multiple emergency vehicles with priority routing.
Mobile app version for on-the-go usage.
Integration with Google Maps API and live GPS tracking.
Advanced AI models for predictive route planning during disasters.
